## Model Providers

However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `env.example`](env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env.local` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env.local` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended for local development)

1. Copy the environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Start the Docker services (PostgreSQL and Redis):
   ```bash
   pnpm docker:up
   ```

3. Install dependencies and start development:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev:setup  # This will start Docker, run migrations, and initialize areas
   ```

4. Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Option 2: Using Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Docker Commands

- `pnpm docker:up` - Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
- `pnpm docker:down` - Stop containers
- `pnpm docker:logs` - View container logs
- `pnpm docker:reset` - Reset containers and volumes (removes all data)
- `pnpm dev:setup` - Complete setup (Docker + migrations + area initialization)

## Real Estate Area Setup

This application includes real estate area management functionality. Each chat is associated with a specific geographic area that includes:

- **Interactive Map**: 2/3 of the chat screen displays an interactive map using Leaflet
- **Area Information**: 1/3 of the screen shows the chat interface with area details
- **Editable Area Data**: Users can edit area name, summary, coordinates, and zoom level
- **Default Area**: New chats are initialized with New York City as the default area

### Database Setup

1. Run the database migration to create the area table:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```

2. Initialize existing chats with default area data:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:init-areas
   ```

### Area Management

- **View Area**: The map automatically displays the area associated with each chat
- **Edit Area**: Click the "Edit" button in the area info panel to modify area details
- **Update Coordinates**: Change latitude, longitude, and zoom level to focus on different areas
- **Area Summary**: Provide detailed descriptions of the real estate area for context
