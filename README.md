## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `env.example`](env.example) to run MapGPT. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env.local` file is all that is necessary.

> **Important**: You should not commit your `.env.local` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# AI Provider
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Database (Postgres with PostGIS)
POSTGRES_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=your_direct_postgres_connection

# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: Other AI providers
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
```

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended for local development)

1. Copy the environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

2. Start the Docker services (PostgreSQL and Redis):
   ```bash
   pnpm docker:up
   ```

3. Install dependencies and start development:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev:setup  # This will start Docker, run migrations, and populate NYC data
   ```

4. Your MapGPT application should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Option 2: Using Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Docker Commands

- `pnpm docker:up` - Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
- `pnpm docker:down` - Stop containers
- `pnpm docker:logs` - View container logs
- `pnpm docker:reset` - Reset containers and volumes (removes all data)
- `pnpm dev:setup` - Complete setup (Docker + migrations + NYC data population)

### NYC Data Population Commands

- `pnpm populate:all` - Populate all NYC datasets (neighborhoods, parks, schools, census, properties)
- `pnpm populate:neighborhoods` - NYC neighborhoods and boundaries
- `pnpm populate:parks` - NYC parks and recreation areas
