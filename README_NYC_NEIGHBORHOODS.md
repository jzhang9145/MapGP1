# NYC Neighborhoods Tool

## Overview
The `nycNeighborhoods` tool allows the AI agent to fetch NYC neighborhood data from the NY Open Data portal. It uses the NYC Trees dataset to calculate neighborhood centers by averaging the locations of all trees within each neighborhood. Note: This approach provides calculated centers rather than full polygon boundaries.

## Features

### âœ… **Data Sources**
- **NY Open Data Portal**: Official NYC government data
- **NYC Trees Dataset**: Individual tree locations within neighborhoods
- **Calculated Centers**: Neighborhood centers calculated from tree location averages
- **Tree Count Data**: Number of trees per neighborhood for context

### ðŸ”§ **Key Capabilities**
- **Borough Filtering**: Filter by specific borough or get all NYC
- **Multiple Formats**: Full GeoJSON or summary information
- **Configurable Limits**: Control the number of neighborhoods returned
- **Real-time Data**: Direct access to NY Open Data API
- **Calculated Centers**: Neighborhood centers calculated from tree location averages
- **Tree Count Information**: Shows number of trees used for center calculation

## Usage Examples

### Get All NYC Neighborhoods
```
"Can you get all NYC neighborhoods?"
```

### Get Manhattan Neighborhoods
```
"Show me the neighborhoods in Manhattan"
```

### Get Summary Information
```

```

### Get Specific Number of Neighborhoods
```
"Get the first 20 neighborhoods from Queens"
```
