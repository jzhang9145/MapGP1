# MapGPT/Nestio - Complete Setup Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up MapGPT (Nestio) on your local desktop environment. This project is an AI-powered real estate and geographic analysis chatbot with interactive maps and spatial analysis capabilities.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

### Required Software
- **Node.js** (v18.0 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **pnpm** (Package manager) - Install with: `npm install -g pnpm`
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

### API Keys Required
- **OpenAI API Key** - Get from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Serper API Key** (for web search) - Get from [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd nestio
```

### 2. Create Environment File
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://nestio:nestio123@localhost:5432/nestio"

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"

# Web Search (Optional)
SERPER_API_KEY="your-serper-api-key-here"

# NextAuth Configuration (Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"

# Application URL
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 3. Start Database Services
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
docker-compose up -d

# Verify containers are running
docker ps
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 5. Setup Database
```bash
# Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Check database connection
pnpm db:studio  # Opens Drizzle Studio (optional)
```

### 6. Populate Geographic Data
This is the most important step - populate the application with NYC geographic and real estate data:

```bash
# 1. NYC Neighborhoods (Required)
npx tsx scripts/populate-nyc-neighborhoods.ts

# 2. NYC Parks
npx tsx scripts/populate-nyc-parks.ts

# 3. NYC School Zones
npx tsx scripts/populate-nyc-school-zones.ts

# 4. Census Blocks (Brooklyn)
npx tsx scripts/populate-nyc-census-blocks.ts

# 5. MapPLUTO Properties (100 sample properties from Brooklyn)
node scripts/populate-mappluto-arcgis.js
```

### 7. Start Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üìä Data Population Details

The application uses several NYC datasets for spatial analysis and mapping:

### Core Geographic Data
1. **NYC Neighborhoods** (~300 neighborhoods with boundaries)
2. **NYC Parks** (~1,700 parks with boundaries) 
3. **NYC School Zones** (~400+ elementary school zones)
4. **Census Blocks** (~1,600 Brooklyn census blocks with demographics)
5. **MapPLUTO Properties** (100 sample tax lot properties with boundaries)

### Data Sources
- **NYC Open Data Portal** - Neighborhoods, Parks, School Zones
- **US Census Bureau** - Census demographic data
- **NYC DCP ArcGIS** - MapPLUTO property data with actual GeoJSON boundaries

### Population Scripts
Each script fetches data from official APIs and populates the PostgreSQL database:

```bash
# Neighborhoods - NYC NTA boundaries
scripts/populate-nyc-neighborhoods.ts

# Parks - NYC Parks Department data  
scripts/populate-nyc-parks.ts

# School Zones - NYC DOE elementary school boundaries
scripts/populate-nyc-school-zones.ts

# Census - Brooklyn demographics from ACS 2023
scripts/populate-nyc-census-blocks.ts

# Properties - Brooklyn tax lots with assessments and zoning
scripts/populate-mappluto-arcgis.js
```

## üîß Manual Database Setup (Alternative)

If Docker doesn't work on your system, you can set up PostgreSQL manually:

### Install PostgreSQL
1. Download and install PostgreSQL 15+ from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. Create a database and user:

```sql
-- Connect as postgres superuser
CREATE DATABASE nestio;
CREATE USER nestio WITH PASSWORD 'nestio123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE nestio TO nestio;

-- Connect to nestio database
\c nestio
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO nestio;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO nestio;
```

3. Update `.env.local` with your database connection string:
```env
POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://nestio:nestio123@localhost:5432/nestio"
```

## üê≥ Docker Commands

The project includes helpful Docker commands:

```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services  
docker-compose down

# Reset everything (removes all data)
docker-compose down -v
docker system prune -f
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Application Features

Once set up, the application provides:

### AI-Powered Tools
- **Spatial Analysis** - Find properties/parks/schools within neighborhoods
- **MapPLUTO Property Search** - Query NYC tax lot data by various criteria
- **Census Data Analysis** - Brooklyn demographic analysis
- **NYC Neighborhoods** - Neighborhood boundary and information lookup
- **NYC Parks** - Park information and boundary data
- **NYC School Zones** - Elementary school zone boundaries

### Interactive Map
- **Leaflet.js** mapping with property boundaries
- **GeoJSON rendering** for neighborhoods, parks, properties
- **Interactive popups** with detailed information
- **Spatial filtering** and analysis visualization

### Example Queries
Once running, try these example queries:

1. **"Find properties in Park Slope"** - Uses spatial analysis
2. **"Show me parks in Brooklyn Heights"** - Spatial park search
3. **"What census blocks have high median income?"** - Demographic analysis
4. **"Find commercial properties with high assessments"** - Property filtering
5. **"Show school zones in DUMBO"** - Educational boundary lookup

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   ```bash
   # Check if PostgreSQL is running
   docker ps
   # Restart if needed
   docker-compose restart postgres
   ```

2. **Migration Failures**
   ```bash
   # Reset database and re-run migrations
   docker-compose down -v
   docker-compose up -d
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```

3. **Data Population Errors**
   ```bash
   # Check API connectivity and re-run specific scripts
   npx tsx scripts/populate-nyc-neighborhoods.ts
   ```

4. **Port Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Check what's using port 3000/5432
   lsof -i :3000
   lsof -i :5432
   ```

### Environment Variables
Make sure all required environment variables are set in `.env.local`:
- `POSTGRES_URL` - Database connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for AI functionality
- `AUTH_SECRET` - Required for authentication

### Data Verification
After population, verify data exists:
```bash
# Open database studio
pnpm db:studio

# Or check via psql
psql postgresql://nestio:nestio123@localhost:5432/nestio -c "
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"NYCNeighborhoods\") as neighborhoods,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"NYCParks\") as parks,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"NYCSchoolZones\") as school_zones,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"NYCCensusBlocks\") as census_blocks,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"NYCMapPLUTO\") as properties;
"
```

Expected counts:
- Neighborhoods: ~300
- Parks: ~1,700  
- School Zones: ~400
- Census Blocks: ~1,600
- MapPLUTO Properties: 100
